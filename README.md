Review: The Grim Series by Dani HarperFYI: this is a short review of the series so there will be a bit about each book in the review.I loved this series and read all 4 books in a row [Storm Warrior, Storm Bound, Storm Warned, Storm Crossed]. Well actually I listened to all 4 books ‚Äì I found it easier than trying to figure out the pronunciation of the occasional bit of Welsh. The narrator was outstanding ‚Äì good use of voice, good pacing, and she got to figure out how to pronounce the Welsh.The setting is Wales, the Nine Realms of the Tylwyth Teg [the Fae or Fair Folk of Welsh legend ‚Äì if you're thinking of Tolkein's elves forget it ‚Äì although impossibly beautiful most of them are NOT pleasant and tend to look upon others as toys or pawns], and modern Washington State. The author mixes the politics of the Nine Realms, the Wild Hunt, Grims [a Grim is a great black dog that serves as a herald of death], and modern Washington with a side order of Ren Faires. She does a good job of giving you what you need to know about Welsh history and mythology within the story flow without burying you in facts.Storm WarriorHero: Rhys, a Welsh warrior who fought against the Romans approximately 2000 years ago. After escaping from the Romans he is captured by the Tylwyth Teg and turned a Grim.Heroine: Morgan, a Washington veterinarian, visits Wales as part of a tour. She keeps seeing this huge black dog everywhere they go and feels sorry for it and offers it kindness. After returning to Washington she is attacked and would have died, should have died, but the Grim intervenes sacrificing his immortality to save her. He is badly injured but she is determined to save him, taking him home to care for him after the surgery to save his life. She is very surprised to find a naked man in place of her dog the next morning, almost as surprised as he is‚Ä¶The remainder of the story involves Rhys finding a place in Morgan's world and Morgan's life ‚Äì with many complications thrown in by the Tylwyth Teg ‚Äì on the way to their happily ever after.Storm BoundHero: Aidan, a 12th century Welsh blacksmith, is taken by Fae princess on his wedding day. His refusal to dishonor his fianc√©e and come to her bed enrages her and he is changed into a Grim until he agrees.Heroine: Brooke, a modern day witch who accidentally saves Aiden from death. Since the princess is not happy to have lost her toy complications result.Storm WarnedHero: Liam is a musician whose world crashed when his wife was unfaithful ‚Äì in living color on YouTube. He is now a reclusive farmer who has given up music in all forms.Heroine: Caris is an 18th century Welsh farm girl with a gift for music that is truly magical. Taken by a plotting Fae princeling, Caris and her ability to influence others with her music is 'stored' for future use by turning her into a Grim. Complications ensue‚Ä¶Storm CrossedHeroes: Trahern, a Fae sorcerer, becomes part of the Wild Hunt in his efforts to save his twin brother, Braith, from the machinations of their mother who has turned him into a Grim.Heroine: Lissy Santiago-Callahan, the single mother of an autistic child who seems to have access to great magical powers.Time passes while they ride with the Hunt and Trahern continues to attempt to free Braith, but to no avail. Then suddenly Braith attaches himself to a child, a human child, and refuses to leave. Trahern is fearful but comes to realize that he too wants to protect the child, and the mother. Both Trahern and Lissy feel that mortal and immortal have nothing in common but they find they do. And yes, complications arise both from the Fae world and from the real world difficulties of raising an autistic child.Each story serves well as a stand-alone but there is a lot character overlap. Can you read them without having read them all or in the right order? Sure, but I think reading them in order enriches the stories but that may just be me. There is also appears to be a series arc going on with Lurien, the Lord of the Wild Hunt, and Gwenhidw, widowed Queen of the Fae.The Grim series of this writing:Storm WarriorStorm BoundStorm WarnedStorm CrossedI truly hope the author continues the series‚Ä¶

Review: Ok. The fae cannot enter her household without an invitation? Why, then, were they able to get in her laundry room at the beginning of the book? There were a few of these discrepancies. I liked the background characters...especially Leo and Ranyon, however, Rhys was very passive aggressive. He was almost placid and not very alpha at all. He is supposed to be this huge, dominant alpha warrior except we really didn't see any of that. He and Morgan barely had an interaction because she spent most of the book telling him he needed help for his mental illness. I mean, how many very obvious signs do you need before you go beyond disbelief and cynicism to just plain dumb? Morgan was dumb as a doorknob. Morgan really, really annoyed me. Anyway, I was disappointed that the warrior was so un-warriorish and that he was paired with a moron. The love scenes were mediocre, too. Rushed. The blurb sounded good and I was really excited to find a new author, but the execution was bad. This series is a NO for me.

Review: What a fun book. I love the legends that the author incorporates into her stories. I found this series because it's on sale and I really enjoyed the first one and then bought all 4 in the series since I like to reread books. The audio is really pretty good- i love listening to the accent and the interesting pronunciation of the words (thus far, I've only listened to this one but i assume that the others are similar). It's an interesting read, generally focused on the story and while there is some romance, this was pretty clean. So, if you're interested in a fantastical story with a lot of mystical elements, this is a fun book. Rhys was cursed to be a dog, a grim, which it seems, can cause mortals to die. He meets Morgan (as a dog) and falls for her. He saves her when she gets attacked but is mortally wounded in the process. She saves him (she's a vet). And then, through her selflessness, saves him from an eternity of servitude. It annoyed me just a bit that she refused to believe him but then again, i'm sure I'd be just as disbelieving. But overall, I loved that this was more of a fantasy novel with a little romance thrown in. The ending was a bit abrupt but the fantasy elements held my interest so much that i wanted to keep this series in my library.

Review: This adventure was fine, it was more about a fae dog getting his life, than anything else. Where was the relationship development? Where was the romance? I hated the mfc; she was so annoying and weak. I liked everyone but her. Why would anyone waste their time on someone constantly saying 'no' and ' away'?I would think this is a teen book but there is sex, not graphic, just a quick little moment. Three stars because I enjoyed the adventure enough to finish it, I guess I kept hoping the two love interests would interact more romantically on the page.
